For past ten years I have been part of the academic research. In particular, I studied the field of
formal analysis and verification, with focus on performance analysis, automatic complexity analysis
and basic formal theory (mainly regarding automata theory). During these years, I have implemented
(or have been part of the developers) of many tools ranging from efficient decisions procedures
(Gaston, dWiNA), automata library (libmata), performance analysis tool suite (Perun), to some minor
products (perfaide, looper, etc.).

I mainly value about myself the following three skills:

  1. **Menthorship**: I have supervised over ten talented and diligent students.
     Each graduated successfully (usually with honors) with highly graded theses. I have supervised
     most of them directly, though some of them with cooperation with some of my collegues (with
     Jirka Pavela, Adam Rogalewicz, and/or Tomáš Vojnar). I take great pride in them, knowing
     I made a difference by making them better (even than myself). 
  2. **Creativity**: I prefer to brainstorm a lot when solving any projects. I believe that so
     called "diffused" thinking is useful for solving every problem. In my projects I encourage
     others to present with their ideas, never discarding anything (there is no stupid idea).
     I am capable with other aspects of creativity as well: writing, presenting, illustrations or
     scheming.
  3. **Versatility**: I think of myself as rather a Jack-of-all-trades, than an expert of the
     particular field (sadly, probably a master of none, though). I believe one should provide for
     his/her project maximal support: a proper documentation, README, testing, continuous
     integration/deployment, performance testing, evaluation, etc. I have experience with each of
     these field and I never omit any of these from my projects.

In the rest of the pages I present more details about myself: publications that I have coauthored,
students that I have (co)supervised, as well as projects that I have (co)developed.
