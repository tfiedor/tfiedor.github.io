For the past ten years I have been part of the academic research. In particular, I studied the
field of formal analysis and verification, with focus on performance analysis, automatic complexity
analysis and basic formal theory (mainly regarding automata theory). During these years, I have
implemented (or have been part of the development) of many tools ranging from efficient decisions
procedures (Gaston, dWiNA), automata libraries (libmata), performance analysis tool suite (Perun), to
some minor products (perfaide, looper, etc.) that were part of research projects.

If I had to list three things that I value about myself, I would say I am:

  1. **Good mentor**: I have supervised over ten talented and diligent students.
     Each graduated successfully (usually with honors) with highly graded theses. I have supervised
     most of them directly, though some of them with cooperation with some of my collegues (with
     Jirka Pavela, Adam Rogalewicz, and/or Tomáš Vojnar). However, I always was a technical
     consultant. I take great pride in all of them, knowing I made a difference by making them
     better (even than myself). They were all great and I would champion them again anytime.
  2. **Creative person**: I prefer to brainstorm a lot when solving any project I am part of. I
     believe that so called "diffused" thinking is useful for solving every problem. In my projects
     I always encourage others to present their ideas, never discarding anything (there is no
     stupid idea), never laughing at any remark.
     However, I am capable with other aspects of creativity as well: writing, presenting,
     illustrating or scheming.
  3. **Versatile developer**: I think of myself as rather a Jack-of-all-trades, than an expert of the
     particular field (sadly, probably a master of none, though). I believe one should provide for
     his/her project maximal support: a proper documentation, well written README, good enough
     testing, working continuous integration/deployment, performance testing, proper evaluation,
     etc. I have experience with each of these fields and I never omit any of these from my
     own projects. Without these, no project is whole.

In my personal life I mainly like reading. I read fantasy fiction (Brandon Sanderson, David
Gemmel), detective fiction (Agatha Christie), as well as non-fiction books (focus on health, science
and technology) and japanese manga. I like walking, working out and swimming (anything, where I can
be alone with my thoughts). I like cooking (I imagine cooking is like OOP: there is a design
pattern in every recipe). I like games (tabletops and role-playing games) with good story or
interesting gameplay. Naturally, I like sea lions.

In the rest of this site I present more details about myself: publications that I have coauthored,
students that I have (co)supervised, as well as projects that I have (co)developed.
