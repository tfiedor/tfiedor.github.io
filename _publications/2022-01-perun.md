In this paper, we present PERUN: an open-source tool suite for profiling-based performance
analysis. At its core, PERUN maintains links between project versions and the corresponding stored
performance profiles, which are then leveraged for automated detection of performance changes in
new project versions. The PERUN tool suite further includes multiple profilers (and is designed
such that further profilers can be easily added), a performance fuzz-tester for workload
generation, methods for deriving performance models, and numerous visualization methods. We
demonstrate how PERUN can help developers to analyze their program performance on two case studies:
detection and localization of a performance degradation and generation of inputs forcing
performance issues to show up.
