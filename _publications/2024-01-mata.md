## My contributions

1. I was the one of the main designers for the experimental evaluation: how the benchmarks were
   run, how the benchmarks were evaluated, and how the results were presented.
2. I was the main devops for the comparison as well as the project: I set up the repositories,
   readmes, and all the necessary informations needed for replication of the results. As well as
   the downloadable virtual machine. I set up the continuous integration, performance tests, etc.
3. I am the main author of the efficient Python binding for the Mata library.

## Abstract

Mata is a well-engineered automata library written in C++ that offers a unique combination of speed
and simplicity. It is meant to serve in applications such as string constraint solving and
reasoning about regular expressions, and as a reference implementation of automata algorithms.
Besides basic algorithms for (non)deterministic automata, it implements a fast simulation reduction
and antichain-based language inclusion checking. The simplicity allows a straightforward access to
the low-level structures, making it relatively easy to extend and modify. Besides the C++ API, the
library also implements a Python binding.

The library comes with a large benchmark of automata problems collected from relevant applications
such as string constraint solving, regular model checking, and reasoning about regular expressions.
We show that Mata is on this benchmark significantly faster than all libraries from a wide range of
automata libraries we collected. Its usefulness in string constraint solving is demonstrated by the
string solver Z3-Noodler, which is based on Mata and outperforms the state of the art in string
constraint solving on many standard benchmarks.
