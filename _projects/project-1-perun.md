Perun is an open source light-weight Performance Version System, which works as a wrapper over
existing Version Control Systems and in parallel manages performance profiles corresponding to
different versions of projects. Moreover, it offers a tool suite suitable for automation of the
performance regression test runs, postprocessing of existing profiles or effective interpretation
of the results.
