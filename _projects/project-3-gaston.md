## My contributions

1. I was the main developer of the Gaston (while being mentored by Ondra Leng√°l).
2. I created the original prototype called `dWiNA`, that was extended to become `gaston`.
3. I was the main designer for the experimental evaluation: how the benchmarks were run, how the benchmarks were
   evaluated, and how the results were presented (currently unpublished). I also created a replication package for
   evaluating the strenghts of our library.

`gaston` is no longer maintained.

##

To install `gaston`, run the following:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tfiedor/Gaston.git
make release
```

## Overview

Gaston is an implementation of backward decision procedure for WS1S logic (weak second-order theory
of k successors). The tool is using libmona a highly optimised deterministic finite tree automata
library that supports semi-symbolic encoding using multi-terminal binary decision diagrams (MTBDDs)
for storing transition table of the automaton. Procedure generates state space on-the-fly and
prunes the states using the antichain-based approach. The tool works on the symbolical
representation of the formula as Symbolic Automata and tries to prove on-the-fly that the initial
states intersect the final states to (dis)prove validity.
