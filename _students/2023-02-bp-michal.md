## Abstract

Software resource consumption is a widely and actively researched area. Of the many resources
utilized by software which can be profiled, energy consumption has long been the one resource
without many generic, and yet comprehensive profilers. In the age of mobile devices and efficient
processing units the need for such profiles is continuously increasing. In this work, we research
methods for accurate measurement of energy consumption of software based on them create an
open-source profiler and implement a comprehensive visualizer of the profiled data. Using the
developed profiler we conduct a number of experiments to showcase its capabilities and demonstrate
the usefulness of measuring software energy consumption.
