consultant. The goal of this thesis was to experimentally try to measure the consumption of the energy of profiled
programs.

## Abstract

Software resource consumption is a widely and actively researched area. Of the many resources utilized by software which can be profiled, energy consumption has long been the one resource without many generic, and yet comprehensive profilers. In the age of mobile devices and efficient processing units the need for such profiles is continuously increasing. In this work, we research methods for accurate measurement of energy consumption of software based on them create an open-source profiler and implement a comprehensive visualizer of the profiled data. Using the developed profiler we conduct a number of experiments to showcase its capabilities and demonstrate the usefulness of measuring software energy consumption.
