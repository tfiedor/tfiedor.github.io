## Abstract

The goal of this thesis is to extend the Performance Version System – Perun by implementing a module for profiling programs written in C# language. This extension implements a tracing profiler with the use of .NET runtime profiling aplication interface. Profiler can collect metrics about trace functions and memory consumption. Measured profiles can then be interpreted into graphs like a scatter plot or a treemap.
