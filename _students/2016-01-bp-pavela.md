## Abstract

Performance bugs may greatly affect the quality of the system being developed and even cause
irreversible damage in some critical sectors. Hence profiling - one of the currently most
widespread technique of performance analysis - is usually applied to find the bugs. However, most
of the current solutions commonly lack comprehensible graphical outputs and detailed analysis of
algorithms in regard to their complexity. This thesis introduces a novel profiling tool which
focuses on automatic estimation of complexity of dynamic data structures. The proposed approach
collects statistical data out of program runs and uses regression analysis to find the most
accurate model serving as an estimate of algorithmic complexity. The resulting prototype was
subjected to a series of experiments that evaluate the accuracy of the results, demonstrate
practical uses and illustrate the graphical output of the tool.
